## Experimentation with Reinforcement Learning

Using the Gymansium's CartPole as a learning env

1. Install prereqs

2. Simple RL agent that chooses random actions for CartPole
   - Shows the CartPole in a display + runs 10 episodes
   - Also, plots the rewards to illustrate the randomness

3. Q-learning
   - Discretize the CartPole states for Q-learning (CartPole is continuous state space, so discretize to use Q-table structure)
   - Bins partitions the continuous range into discrete intervals/categories
